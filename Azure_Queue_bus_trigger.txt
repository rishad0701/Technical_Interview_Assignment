--> First we will create the Service bus namespace 
--> After creation we will create the queue inside that service bus namespace
--> After that inside shared access policies and inside rootmanagesharedaccesskey we will have connection string
--> Now create web api project and inside appsetting.json file we will configure service bus connection tring and queue as below
{
  "AzureServiceBus": {
    "ConnectionString": "<your_service_bus_connection_string>",
    "QueueName": "myqueue"
  }
}

--> Now inside controller we can write the api to send message to azure app service bus queue using Azureservicebus connectionstring and queue name.


--> Now we should create the azure app function project using with service bus queue trigger template as per our requirement and we can define the quename and connectionstring 
    as well while creating the project and we can define that connection string in local.setting.json file. using this string only we can connect with azure bus queue 
    so that whenever we get data into azure bus the fuction get triggered.
--> So now function will get created if we want we can add other functions as well.
